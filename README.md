The idea behind CuraGUARD was born from real-world observations and user needs:

- Tech like NLP and voice assistants are now mainstream and effective
- Post-COVID, digital health solutions are more necessary than ever
- Most symptom tools are too clinical—CuraGUARD feels human
- A shift toward **preventive healthcare** needs smart daily tools

## 🌐 One Doctor vs. All-in-One Assistant
Unlike a doctor who typically specializes in a single field (e.g., dermatology, cardiology, ENT), CuraGUARD is not limited by one area of expertise. Instead, it is trained on a diverse dataset covering a wide range of common medical conditions across multiple specialties
